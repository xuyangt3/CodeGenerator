# CodeGenerator

This piece of program reads from a Javadoc (in HTML) and generates the corresponding DECLARATIONS and comments of the java class.
It is intended to save the time for repeated work if you are offered a javadoc and are required to implement it, because copying and pasting 150 lines of declarations plus comments and then formatting them by hand before you start with the MP is painful!
